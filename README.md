# ðŸ“ˆ Trending

WiseBuyer **for 12.12** has been pushed. Check [This branch](https://github.com/OliverS18/WiseBuyer/tree/12.12 "branch URL") for details.

# Introduction

When it comes to 11.11 or other e-commercial events, there are usually a lot of rules with great complexities, where customers have to do a hard math to manage their shoplist to acquire a relatively high discount. **Now WiseBuyer is here to provide an easy solution.** Just add your favorite goods to the cart and WiseBuyer will do all the rest work for you, providing a set of found sensible choices for your reference at the end.

# Demo

![demo](doc/demo.gif "demo")

# Requirements

- #### MacOS X

- #### Chrome 78.0

- #### Python 3.6+

- #### Anaconda

- #### Other dependencies specifies in `configs/environment.yaml`

**Note:**  
When the program is called for the first time, the dependencies will automatically install into a new conda environment called `Coupon`. Then the entrance shell script `WiseBuyer` needs to source your `~/.bash_profile` to enable the created sub-shell to call conda commands. So ensure that there are conda commands defined in your `~/.bash_profile`, which is usually automatically generated when installing Anaconda.

# Usage

### Pull the source code

```bash
git clone git@github.com:OliverS18/WiseBuyer.git
cd WiseBuyer
```

Then you can run the program with interactive manner or passive manner.

### Interactive mode

Just one-line command below and follow the prompts.

```bash
./WiseBuyer
```

**Note:**  
Due to the restriction of *Taobao.com*, WiseBuyer requires you to login in order to acquire information of the goods in your cart. Your authentication is **guaranteed** to be used **only** to acquire no more than necessary information and also will **not** be preserved for other use.

### Passive mode

WiseBuyer also allows argument passed from terminal like:

```bash
./WiseBuyer -l -b 1600
```

The usage of supported arguments can be found by:

```bash
./WiseBuyer -h
```

# Notice

- Current support *Taobao.com*/*Tmall.com* only.

- WiseBuyer is still under development.  
~~Since the coupon element is not shown up on *Taobao.com* during current development, WiseBuyer is not guaranteed to acquire correct platform coupons. The issue will be fixed during the upcoming 12.12.~~  
WiseBuyer is now able to acquire 12.12 coupons. See **branch 12.12**.

# TODO

- [x] Check the coupon element when it is exposed during 12.12
- [ ] Develop GUI
- [ ] Code optimization
- [ ] Support Chinese
- [ ] Support Windows & test on Linux
- [ ] Take postage cost into account

Welcome pull request.
